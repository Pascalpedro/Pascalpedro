## Hi, I am Pascal... ü§ù

I am a DevOps engineer with years of experience building Enterprise Network Solutions.

I have a strong background in Network and Linux Server administration with a strong understanding of shell scripting using Bash and Python for task automation, and I am proficient in using Git and GitHub for source code version control with CI/CD pipeline code deployment tools like Docker, Ansible, and Zendesk for CRM quality tracking. I have competency in building, configuring, and managing cloud-based infrastructure deployed to cloud hosting platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Digital Ocean Cloud.

I have spent the last couple of years working on open-sourced projects in both the DevOps and cloud aspects of technology. I am experienced in IT solution-building and platform evaluation, adept at strategic project planning, and in tune with new developments in my field.

Additionally, outside of my technical skills, I have perfected my Agility, Collaboration, and Communication skills. I am a capable and consistent problem solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency.

I have the vision to participate as a critical player and work in healthy environments that call for competencies, skills, experience, and strategic leadership while collaborating effectively using Agile methodologies to ensure maximal business impact.
